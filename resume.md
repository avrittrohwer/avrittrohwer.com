## Experience

### Software Engineer, Google Kubernetes Engine

[*September 2019 - current*]{.date}

- Designed and implemented a Kubernetes Control Plane VM bootstrap success rate
  SLI and SLO. Designed and implemented logs observability pipeline and fleet
  analytics tooling. Utilized tooling to identify 15 unique failure modes, 6 of
  which were proactively caught via SLO alerts. Implemented or delegated
  mitigations as appropriate, achieving consistent per-minor-version,
  per-location 99.9% success rate.
- Designed and implemented an oncall ticket responder that provides useful
  debugging context. Delivered highest-priority functionality for my team,
  reducing our alert median-time-to-resolution by 18 hours. Wrote a design to
  make the responder usable and extendable by other teams. The design was
  implemented by another team who used it reduce their customer issue
  mean-time-to-resolution by 5 days.
- Wrote and maintained a fleet analysis Colab (Jupyter notebook) template.
  Utilized tooling to identify impact of 8 production issues. Facilitated and
  led 3 team training sessions on data analysis.
- Collaborated with customer support organization to reduce toil. Proposed
  a streamlined customer outreach process for our team which has saved 100+
  extraneous tickets from being created. Wrote playbooks and adjusted
  permission policies enabling support engineers to run common mitigation commands.
- Designed a ramp-up project for a new engineer joining the team. Provided
  one-on-one mentorship enabling successful implementation.

### Software Engineer, Google.org Fellow on CiviForm

*September 2022 - March 2023*

- Led enhancements to the [CiviForm cloud deployment
  tool](https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/sre-playbook/terraform-deploy-system).
  Wrote a [6 month roadmap and delivery
  plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgKX1uSFHOJooSsBRoefc1VhNIKCBwKHg6ZrGys84cM/edit?usp=sharing).
- Helped ensure a successful launch in the state of Arkansas. Collaborated with
  state IT administrators to fix deployment issues and ensure CiviForm
  integrated into their infrastructure.
- Designed and implemented the [pgadmin
  command](https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/sre-playbook/terraform-deploy-system#aws)
  allowing for temporary database access via a [web
  UI](https://www.pgadmin.org/).
- Designed and implemented [end-to-end
  testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1IFnuorFIsGJggMwJdLgAHtGMGPr9XDd8AdXH5VAlw/edit?usp=sharing)
  of the cloud deployment tool.

  and implemented [documentation
  generation](https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/sre-playbook/server-environment-variables)
  for all environment variables the CiviForm server reads from. Added a [GitHub
  action](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/blob/main/.github/workflows/pr_env_var_docs.yaml)
  that ensures any added environment variables have corresponding
  documentation.
